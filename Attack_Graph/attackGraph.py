The result is that every time a new Firefox process is started, drakon.dll is injected into it automatically and executed.  We configured the OC2 to automatically run the same script each time a new connection was received, including hostname, whoami, and ps.

    # Frankenstein Campaign
    sample = r'''In order to compromise their victims, the threat actors sent the trojanized Microsoft Word documents, probably via email. The first vector relies on a trojanized document that fetches a remote template and then uses a known exploit. The second vector is a trojanized Word document that prompts the victim to enable macros and run a Visual Basic script. We were able to correlate these two techniques to the same threat campaign due to overlapping threat actor C2.
        In the first scenario, Talos discovered a document named "MinutesofMeeting-2May19.docx", that appeared to display the national flag of Jordan. Once the victim opens the document, it fetches a remove template from the actor-controlled website, hxxp://droobox[.]online:80/luncher.doc. Once the luncher.doc was downloaded, it used CVE-2017-11882, to execute code on the victim's machine. After the exploit, the file would run a command script to set up persistence as a scheduled task named "WinUpdate". That scheduled task would run a series of base64-encoded PowerShell commands that acted as a stager. The stager will be described in more detail in the next section.
        As soon as the user enabled the macro, a robust Visual Basic Application (VBA) script began to execute. The VBA script contained two anti-analysis features. First, it would query Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to check if any of the following applications were running.
        Once the evasion checks were complete, the threat actors used MSbuild to execute an actor-created file named "LOCALAPPDATA\Intel\instal.xml". Based on lexical analysis, we assess with high confidence that this component of the macro script was based on an open-source project called "MSBuild-inline-task." While this technique was previously documented last year, it has rarely been observed being used in operations. Talos suspects the adversary chose MSBuild because it is a signed Microsoft binary, meaning that it can bypass application whitelisting controls on the host when being used to execute arbitrary code.
        Once the "instal.xml" file began execution, it would deobfuscate the base64-encoded commands. This revealed a stager, or a small script designed to obtain an additional payload. While analyzing this stager, we noticed some similarities to the "Get-Data" function of the FruityC2 PowerShell agent. One notable difference is that this particular stager included functionality that allowed the stager to communicate with the command and control (C2) via an encrypted RC4 byte stream. In this sample, the threat actors' C2 server was the domain msdn[.]cloud.
        the C2 would return a string of characters. Once the string was RC4 decrypted, it launched a PowerShell Empire agent. The PowerShell script would attempt to enumerate the host to look for certain information. Once the aforementioned information was obtained, it was sent back to the threat actor's C2.'''
    sample = '''
        All observed attacks start with an email message, containing either a malicious attachment or a URL which leads to the first stage of the attack. The text of the emails is likely taken from legitimate email, such as mailing lists that targeted organizations may be subscribed to. Below are three examples, with the first one purporting to be sent by the European Banking Federation and is using a newly registered domain for the spoofed sender email address. The attachment is a malicious PDF file that entices the user to click on a URL to download and open a weaponized RTF file containing exploits for CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2017-8570 and CVE-2018-8174. The final payload is a JScript backdoor also known as More_eggs that allows the attacker to control the affected system remotely.
        Notable applications used in these attacks are cmstp and msxsl. The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (cmstp.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles. Cmstp accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections. A malicious INF file can be supplied as a parameter to download and execute remote code. Cmstp may also be used to load and execute COM scriptlets (SCT files) from remote servers.
        Microsoft allows developers to create COM+ objects in script code stored in an XML document, a so-called scriptlet file. Although it is common to use JScript or VBScript, as they are available in Windows by default, a scriptlet can contain COM+ objects implemented in other languages, including Perl and Python, which would be fully functional if the respective interpreters are installed.
        To bypass AppLocker and launching script code within a scriptlet, the attacker includes the malicious code within an XML script tag placed within the registration tag of the scriptlet file and calls cmstp with appropriate parameters.
        An earlier part of the second stage is implemented as an encrypted JScript scriptlet which eventually drops a randomly named COM server DLL binary with a .txt filename extension, for example, 9242.txt, in the user's home folder and registers the server using the regsvr32.exe utility.The dropper contains an encrypted data blob that is decrypted and written to the disk. The dropper then launches the next stage of the attack by starting PowerShell, msxsl or cmstp.exe as described above.
        The PowerShell chain is launched from an obfuscated JScript scriptlet previously downloaded from the command and control (C2) server and launched using cmstp.exe. The first PowerShell stage is a simple downloader that downloads the next PowerShell stage and launches a child instance of powershell.exe using the downloaded, randomly named script as the argument. The downloaded PowerShell script code is obfuscated in several layers before the last layer is reached. The last layer loads shellcode into memory and creates a thread within the PowerShell interpreter process space.
        On the PowerShell side of the infection chain, the downloaded final payload is a Cobalt Strike beacon, which provides the attacker with rich backdoor functionality.

This results in the user seeing only the Flash_Adobe_Install.exe file to execute in order to install what they believe to be an update to Flash Player. When run, it will automatically load goopdate.dll due to search order hijacking. Goopdate.dll is a highly obfuscated loader whose ultimate purpose is to load a Cobalt Strike stager into memory and then execute it. The Cobalt Strike stager will simply try to download and execute a shellcode from a remote server, in this case using the following URL: summerevent.webhop.net/QuUA

        Due to its ubiquitous use, many common infrastructure products from Microsoft, Apple, Twitter, CloudFlare and others are vulnerable to Log4Shell attacks. Recently, VMware also issued guidance that some components of its Horizon service are vulnerable to Log4j exploits, leading OverWatch to add the VMware Horizon Tomcat web server service to their processes-to-watch list, researchers said.
        The Falcon OverWatch team noticed the Aquatic Panda intrusion when the threat actor performed multiple connectivity checks via DNS lookups for a subdomain under dns[.]1433[.]eu[.]org, executed under the Apache Tomcat service running on the VMware Horizon instance, they wrote in the post.
        “The threat actor then executed a series of Linux commands, including attempting to execute a bash-based interactive shell with a hardcoded IP address as well as curl and wget commands in order to retrieve threat-actor tooling hosted on remote infrastructure,” researchers wrote.
        The commands were executed on a Windows host under the Apache Tomcat service, researchers said. They triaged the initial activity and immediately sent a critical detection to the victim organization, later sharing additional details directly with their security team, they said.
        Eventually, researchers assessed that a modified version of the Log4j exploit was likely used during the course of the threat actor’s operations, and that the infrastructure used in the attack is linked to Aquatic Panda, they said.
        OverWatch researchers tracked the threat actor’s activity closely during the intrusion to provide continuous updates to academic institution as its security administrators scrambled to mitigate the attack, they said.
        Aquatic Panda engaged in reconnaissance from the host, using native OS binaries to understand current privilege levels as well as system and domain details. Researchers also observed the group attempt discover and stop a third-party endpoint detection and response (EDR) service, they said.
        The threat actors downloaded additional scripts and then executed a Base64-encoded command via PowerShell to retrieve malware from their toolkit. They also retrieved three files with VBS file extensions from remote infrastructure, which they then decoded.
        “Based on the telemetry available, OverWatch believes these files likely constituted a reverse shell, which was loaded into memory via DLL search-order hijacking,” researchers wrote.
        Aquatic Panda eventually made multiple attempts to harvest credentials by dumping the memory of the LSASS process using living-off-the-land binaries rdrleakdiag.exe and cdump.exe, a renamed copy of createdump.exe.
        “The threat actor used winRAR to compress the memory dump in preparation for exfiltration before attempting to cover their tracks by deleting all executables from the ProgramData and Windows\temp\ directories,” researchers wrote.
        The victim organization eventually patched the vulnerable application, which prevented further action from Aquatic Panda on the host and stopped the attack, researchers said.
