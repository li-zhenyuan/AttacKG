abstract = {Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), as a collection of threat information , has been widely used in industry to defend against prevalent cyber attacks. CTI is commonly represented as Indicator of Compromise (IOC) for formalizing threat actors. However, current CTI studies pose three major limitations: first, the accuracy of IOC extraction is low; second, isolated IOC hardly depicts the comprehensive landscape of threat events; third, the interdependent relationships among heterogeneous IOCs, which can be leveraged to mine deep security insights, are unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel CTI framework, HINTI, to model the interdependent relationships among heterogeneous IOCs to quantify their relevance. Specifically, we first propose multi-granular attention based IOC recognition method to boost the accuracy of IOC extraction. We then model the interdependent relationships among IOCs using a newly constructed heterogeneous information network (HIN). To explore intricate security knowledge, we propose a threat intelligence computing framework based on graph convolutional networks for effective knowledge discovery. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed IOC extraction approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, and HINTI can model and quantify the underlying relationships among heterogeneous IOCs, shedding new light on the evolving threat landscape.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of the cyber attacks, sharing of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) becomes essential to identify and respond to cyber attack in timely and cost-effective manner. However, with the lack of standard languages and automated analytics of cyber threat information, analyzing complex and unstructured text of CTI reports is extremely time-and labor-consuming. Without addressing this challenge, CTI sharing will be highly impractical, and attack uncertainty and time-To-defend will continue to increase. Considering the high volume and speed of CTI sharing, our aim in this paper is to develop automated and context-Aware analytics of cyber threat intelligence to accurately learn attack pattern (TTPs) from commonly available CTI sources in order to timely implement cyber defense actions. Our paper has three key contributions. First, it presents a novel threat-Action ontology that is sufficiently rich to understand the specifications and context of malicious actions. Second, we developed a novel text mining approach that combines enhanced techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information retrieval (IR) to extract threat actions based on semantic (rather than syntactic) relationship. Third, our CTI analysis can construct a complete attack pattern by mapping each threat action to the appropriate techniques, tactics and kill chain phases, and translating it any threat sharing standards, such as STIX 2.1. Our CTI analytic techniques were implemented in a tool, called TTPDrill, and evaluated using a randomly selected set of SymantecThreat Reports. Our evaluation tests show that TTPDrill achieves more than 82% of precision and recall in a variety of measures, very reasonable for this problem domain.},

abstract = {The term "threat intelligence" has swiftly become a staple buzzword in the computer security industry. The entirely reasonable premise is that, by compiling up-to-date information about known threats (i.e., IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, etc.), recipients of such information may be able to better defend their systems from future attacks. Thus, today a wide array of public and commercial sources distribute threat intelligence data feeds to support this purpose. However, our understanding of this data, its characterization and the extent to which it can meaningfully support its intended uses, is still quite limited. In this paper, we address these gaps by formally defining a set of metrics for characterizing threat intelligence data feeds and using these measures to systematically characterize a broad range of public and commercial sources. Further , we ground our quantitative assessments using external measurements to qualitatively investigate issues of coverage and accuracy. Unfortunately, our measurement results suggest that there are significant limitations and challenges in using existing threat intelligence data for its purported goals.},

abstract = {To adapt to the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats, security professionals are actively exchanging Indicators of Compromise (IOC) (e.g., malware signatures, botnet IPs) through public sources (e.g. blogs, forums, tweets, etc.). Such information, often presented in articles, posts, white papers etc., can be converted into a machine-readable OpenIOC format for automatic analysis and quick deployment to various security mechanisms like an intrusion detection system. With hundreds of thousands of sources in the wild, the IOC data are produced at a high volume and velocity today, which becomes increasingly hard to manage by humans. Efforts to automatically gather such information from unstructured text, however, is impeded by the limitations of today's Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, which cannot meet the high standard (in terms of accuracy and coverage) expected from the IOCs that could serve as direct input to a defense system. In this paper, we present iACE, an innovation solution for fully automated IOC extraction. Our approach is based on the observation that the IOCs in technical articles are often described in a predictable way: being connected to a set of context terms (e.g., "download") through stable grammatical relations. Leveraging this observation, iACE is designed to automatically locate a putative IOC token (e.g., a zip file) and its context (e.g., "malware", "down-load") within the sentences in a technical article, and further analyze their relations through a novel application of graph mining techniques. Once the grammatical connection between the tokens is found to be in line with the way that the IOC is commonly presented , these tokens are extracted to generate an OpenIOC item that describes not only the indicator (e.g., a malicious zip file) but also its context (e.g., download from an external source). Running on 71,000 articles collected from 45 leading technical blogs, this new approach demonstrates a remarkable performance: it generated 900K OpenIOC items with a precision of 95% and a coverage over 90%, which is way beyond what the state-of-the-art NLP technique and industry IOC tool can achieve, at a speed of thousands of articles per hour. Further, by correlating the IOCs mined from the articles published over a 13-year span, our study sheds new light on 1 The two lead authors are ordered alphabetically.},

abstract = {Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) is being used to search for indicators of attacks that might have compromised an enterprise network for a long time without being discovered. To have a more effective analysis, CTI open standards have incorporated descriptive relationships showing how the indicators or observables are related to each other. However, these relationships are either completely overlooked in information gathering or not used for threat hunting. In this paper, we propose a system, called Poirot, which uses these correlations to uncover the steps of a successful attack campaign. We use kernel audits as a reliable source that covers all causal relations and information flows among system entities and model threat hunting as an inexact graph pattern matching problem. Our technical approach is based on a novel similarity metric which assesses an alignment between a query graph constructed out of CTI correlations and a provenance graph constructed out of kernel audit log records. We evaluate Poirot on publicly released real-world incident reports as well as reports of an adversarial engagement designed by DARPA, including ten distinct attack campaigns against different OS platforms such as Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows. Our evaluation results show that Poirot is capable of searching inside graphs containing millions of nodes and pinpoint the attacks in a few minutes, and the results serve to illustrate that CTI correlations could be used as robust and reliable artifacts for threat hunting.},

abstract = {With the development of information technology, the border of the cyberspace gets much broader, exposing more and more vulnerabilities to attackers. Traditional mitigation-based defence strategies are challenging to cope with the current complicated situation. Security practitioners urgently need better tools to describe and modelling attacks for defence. The provenance graph seems like an ideal method for threat modelling with powerful semantic expression ability and attacks historic correlation ability. In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic concepts about system-level provenance graph and proposed typical system architecture for provenance graph-based threat detection and investigation. A comprehensive provenance graph-based threat detection system can be divided into three modules, namely,”data collection module”,”data management module”, and”threat detection modules”. Each module contains several components and involves many research problem. We systematically analyzed the algorithms and design details involved. By comparison, we give the strategy of technology selection. Moreover, we pointed out the shortcomings of the existing work for future improvement.},

abstract = {Log-based cyber threat hunting has emerged as an important solution to counter sophisticated cyber attacks. However , existing approaches require non-trivial efforts of manual query construction and have overlooked the rich external knowledge about threat behaviors provided by open-source Cyber Threat Intelligence (OSCTI). To bridge the gap, we propose EFFHUNTER, a system that facilitates cyber threat hunting in computer systems using OSCTI. Built upon mature system auditing frameworks, EFFHUNTER provides (1) an unsupervised, lightweight , and accurate NLP pipeline that extracts structured threat behaviors from unstructured OSCTI text, (2) a concise and expressive domain-specific query language, TBQL, to hunt for malicious system activities, (3) a query synthesis mechanism that automatically synthesizes a TBQL query for threat hunting from the extracted threat behaviors, and (4) an efficient query execution engine to search the big audit logging data. Evaluations on a broad set of attack cases demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of EFFHUNTER in enabling practical threat hunting.},

abstract = {Modern cyber attacks consist of a series of steps and are generally part of larger campaigns. Large-scale field data provides a quantitative measurement of these campaigns. On the other hand, security practitioners extract and report qualitative campaign characteristics manually. Linking the two sources provides new insights about attacker strategies from measurements. However, this is a time-consuming task because qualitative measurements are generally reported in natural language and are not machine-readable. We propose an approach to bridge measurement data with manual analysis. We borrow the idea from threat intelligence: we define campaigns using a 4-stage model, and describe each stage using IOCs (indicators of compromise), e.g. URLs and IP addresses. We train a multi-class classifier to extract IOCs and further categorize them into different stages. We implement these ideas in a system called ChainSmith. Our system can achieve 91.9% precision and 97.8% recall in extracting IOCs, and can determine the campaign roles for 86.2% of IOCs with 78.2% precision and 80.7% recall. We run ChainSmith on 14,155 online security articles, from which we collect 24,653 IOCs. The semantic roles allow us to link manual attack analysis with large scale field measurements. In particular, we study the effectiveness of different persuasion techniques used on enticing user to download the payloads. We find that the campaign usually starts from social engineering and 'missing codec' ruse is a common persuasion technique that generates the most suspicious downloads each day.},
