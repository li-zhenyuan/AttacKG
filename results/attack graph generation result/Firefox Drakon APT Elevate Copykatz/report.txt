First attacked ta51-pivot-2 and deployed OC2, allowing us to run our attack from within the target network.  Exploited Firefox backdoor by again browsing to http://128.55.12.233.  Loader Drakon was executed in Firefox memory and connected out to 128.55.12.233:8000 and 128.55.12.233:443 for C2.  After the BBN reboot, driver was disabled, and we would now be able to use privilege escalation via our perfmon driver.  We loaded the copykatz module to recon data from the system.
