is very common, and rather maddening, for the command to fail either with
a message about a module/kernel version mismatch or a pile of unresolved

the technical aspects of loading LKMs are considerably different, and
the most visible manifestation of this is that the LKM file has a suffix
of ".ko" instead of ".o".  From the user point of
view, it looks quite similar, though.</P

>A common error is to try to insert an object file which is not an LKM.
For example, you configure your kernel to have the USB core module
bound into the base kernel instead of generated as an LKM.  In that
case, you end up with a file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>usbcore.o</TT
>, which looks
pretty much the same as the <TT

>5.2. What Happens When An LKM Loads</H2
><P
>So you've successfully loaded an LKM, and verified that via
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/modules</TT
>.  But how do you know it's working?
That's up to the LKM, and varies according to what kind of LKM it is,
but here are some of the more common actions of an LKM upon being loaded.</P
><P
>The first thing a device driver LKM does after loading (which is what
the module would do at boot time if it were bound into the base
kernel) is usually to search the system for a device it knows how to
drive.  Just how it does this search varies from one driver to the 
next, and can usually be controlled by module parameters.  But in any
case, if the driver doesn't find any device it is capable of driving,
it causes the load to fail.  Otherwise, the driver registers itself
as the driver for a particular major number and you can start using
the device it found via a device special file that specifies that
major number.  It may also register itself as the handler for the
interrupt level that the device uses.  It may also send setup commands
to the device, so you may see lights blink or something like that.</P
><P
>You can see that a device driver has registered itself in the file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/devices</TT
>.  You can see that the device
driver is handling the device's interrupts in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/interrupts</TT
>.</P
><P
>A nice device driver issues kernel messages telling what devices it
found and is prepared to drive.  (Kernel messages in most systems end
up on the console and in the file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/var/log/messages</TT
>.  You can also display recent
ones with the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>dmesg</B
> program).  Some drivers, however, are
silent.  A nice device driver also gives you (in kernel messages) some
details of its search when it fails to find a device, but many just
fail the load without explanation, and what you get is a list of
guesses from <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> as to what the problem might
have been.</P
><P
>A network device (interface) driver works similarly, except that the
LKM registers a device name of its choosing
(e.g. <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>eth0</TT
>) rather than a major number.  You can
see the currently registered network device names in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/proc/net/dev</TT
></P
><P
>A filesystem driver, upon loading, registers itself as the driver for
a filesystem type of a certain name.  For example, the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>msdos</TT
> driver registers itself as the driver for the
filesystem type named <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>msdos</TT
>.  (LKM authors typically
name the LKM the same as the filesystem type it will drive).</P

>5.3. Intelligent Loading Of LKMs - Modprobe</H2
><P
>Once you have module loading and unloading figured out using
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> and <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rmmod</B
>, you can let
the system do more of the work for you by using the higher level
program <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

<B
CLASS="COMMAND"

> man page for details.</P
><P
>The main thing that <B

> does is automatically
load the prerequisites of an LKM you request.  It does this with the
help of a file that you create with <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>depmod</B
> and keep
on your system.</P

>This performs an <B

<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>msdos.o</TT
>, but before that does an
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>insmod</B
> of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>fat.o</TT
>, since you
have to have <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>fat.o</TT
> loaded before you can load
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>msdos.o</TT
>.</P
><P
>The other major thing <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>modprobe</B
> does for you is to
find the object module containing the LKM given just the name of the
LKM.  For example, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>modprobe msdos</B
> might load
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/2.4.2-2/fs/msdos.o</TT
>.  
In fact, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>modprobe</B
>'s argument may be a totally
symbolic name that you have associated with some actual module.  For
example, <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>modprobe eth0</B
> loads the appropriate network
device driver to create and drive your <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>eth0</TT
> device,
assuming you set that up properly in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>modules.conf</TT
>.
Check out the man pages
for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>modprobe</B
> and the configuration file
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>modules.conf</TT
> (usually
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/modules.conf</TT
>) for details on the search
rules <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>modprobe</B
> uses.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>modprobe</B
> is especially important because it
is by default the program that the kernel module loader uses to load
an LKM on demand.  So if you use automatic module loading, you will 
need to set up <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>modules.conf</TT
> properly or
things will not work.  See <A
HREF="x197.html#AUTOLOAD"
>Section 5.4</A
>.</P
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>depmod</B
> scans your LKM object files (typically all
the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.o</TT
> files in the appropriate <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules</TT
> subdirectory) and figures
out which LKMs prerequire (refer to symbols in) other LKMs.  It
generates a dependency file (typically named
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>modules.dep</TT
>), which you normally keep in
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules</TT
> for use by
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>modprobe</B
>.</P
><P
>You can use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>modprobe</B
> to remove stacks of LKMs as
well.</P
><P
>Via the LKM configuration file (typically
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/modules.conf</TT
>), you can fine tune the
dependencies and do other fancy things to control LKM selections.  And
you can specify programs to run when you insert and remove LKMs, for
example to initialize a device driver.</P
><P
>If you are maintaining one system and memory is not in short supply,
it is probably easier to avoid <B
CLASS="COMMAND"

modern systems.  It may make sense in a very small memory system, because

>5.4.2.2. Removing The Autoclean LKMs</H4
><P
>The purpose of the autoclean flag is to let you automatically
remove LKMs that haven't been used in a while (typically 1 minute).
So by using automatic module loading and unloading, you can keep loaded only
parts of the kernel that are presently needed, and save memory.</P
><P
>This is less important than it once was, with memory being much
cheaper.  If you don't need to save memory, you shouldn't bother with
the complexity of module loader processes.  Just load everything you
might need via an initialization script and keep it loaded.</P
><P
>There is a form of the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>delete_module</TT
> system call that
says, "remove all LKMs that have the autoclean flag set and haven't
been used in a while."  Kerneld typically calls this once per 
minute.  You can call it explicitly with an <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rmmod --all</B
>
command.</P
><P
>As the kernel module loader does not do any removing of LKMs, if you
use that you might want to have a cron job that does a <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>rmmod
--all</B
> periodically.</P

on the LKM being loaded.  Typical "things" are open devices
or mounted fileystems.  It is important because you cannot remove an
LKM unless the use count is zero.  The LKM itself maintains this
count, but the module manager uses it to decide whether to permit an
unload.</P
><P
>There is an exception to the above description of the use count.  You
may see -1 in the use count column.  What that means is that this LKM
does not use use counts to determine when it is OK to unload.
Instead, the LKM has registered a subroutine that the module manager
can call that will return an indication of whether or not it is OK to
unload the LKM.  In this case, the LKM ought to provide you with some
custom interface, and some documentation, to determine when the LKM is
free to be unloaded.</P

dependencies by unloading the dependent LKMs.</P
><P
>The "(unused)" legend means the LKM has never been used,
i.e. it has never been in a state where it could not be unloaded.  The
kernel tracks this information for one simple reason: to assist in
automatic LKM unloading policy.  In a system where LKMs are loaded and
unloaded automatically (see <A
HREF="x197.html#AUTOLOAD"
>Section 5.4</A
>), you don't want
to automatically load an LKM and then, before the guy who needed it
loaded has a chance to use it, unload it because it is not in use.</P

This is an LKM that is in "deleted" state.  It's something of a
misnomer -- what it means is that the LKM is in the process of being 
unloaded.  You can no longer load LKMs that depend on it, but it's still
present in the system.  Unloading an LKM is usually close to instantaneous,
so if you see this status, you probably have a broken LKM.  Its cleanup
routine probably got into an infinite loop or stall or crashed (causing a
kernel oops).  If that's the case, the only way to clear this status is to
reboot.</P
><P
>There are similar statuses "initializing" and
"uninitialized".</P

>5.6. Where Are My LKM Files On My System?</H2
><P
>The LKM world is flexible enough that the files you need to load could
live just about anywhere on your system, but there is a convention
that most systems follow:  The LKM .o files are in the directory
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/lib/modules</TT
>, divided
into subdirectories.  There is one subdirectory for each version of
the kernel, since LKMs are specific to a kernel (see <A
HREF="basekerncompat.html"
>Section 6</A
>).  Each subdirectory contains a complete set
of LKMs.</P
><P
>The subdirectory name is the value you get from the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uname
--release</B
> command, for example <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2.2.19</TT
>.
<A
HREF="basekerncompat.html#MULTIPLEKERNELS"
>Section 6.3</A
> tells how you control that value.</P
><P
>When you build Linux, a standard <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make modules</B
> and
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make modules_install</B
> should install all the LKMs
that are part of Linux in the proper release subdirectory.</P
><P
>If you build a lot of kernels, another organization may be more
helpful:  keep the LKMs together with the base kernel and other kernel-related
files in a subdirectory of /boot.  The only drawback of this is that you 
cannot have /boot reside on a tiny disk partition.  In some systems, /boot
is on a special tiny "boot partition" and contains only enough files
to get the system up to the point that it can mount other filesystems.</P
