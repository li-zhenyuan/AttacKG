></H1
><P
>Traditional Unix systems keep user account information, including
one-way encrypted passwords, in a text file called
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/passwd</TT
></TT
>''.  As this file is
used by many tools (such as ``ls'') to display file ownerships, etc. by
matching user id #'s with the user's names, the file needs to be
world-readable.  Consequentally, this can be somewhat of a security
risk.</P
><P
>Another method of storing account information, one that I always
use, is with the shadow password format.  As with the traditional method,
this method stores account information in the /etc/passwd file in a
compatible format.  However, the password is stored as a single
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"x"</SPAN
> character (ie.  not actually stored in this file).  A
second file, called
``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/shadow</TT
></TT
>'', contains
encrypted password as well as other information such as account or
password expiration values, etc.  The /etc/shadow file is readable only
by the root account and is therefore less of a security risk.</P
><P
>While some other Linux distributions forces you to install the
Shadow Password Suite in order to use the shadow format, Red Hat makes it
simple.  To switch between the two formats, type (as root):</P

You could create a script file called

that would display some kind of error message and log the user off, and
