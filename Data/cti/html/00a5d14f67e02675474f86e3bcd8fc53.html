Along with the difficulty of remediating such attacks and the persistent access afforded to a successful attacker, we expect this technique to present a major challenge for defenders, SOCs and security teams.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Detecting and Hunting Golden SAML Attack</h4><p>Based on understanding the attack process and modeling the attack in several environments, we recommend the following analyses to detect a Golden SAML attack. While there are many potential detection mechanisms which are only applicable when attackers erroneously leave unnecessary traces, our focus in this section will be on analyses capable of detecting any standard Golden SAML attack.</p><p>The analyses proposed here are designed for a standard Golden SAML attack, targeting an on-prem ADFS architecture. Other variations of SAML attacks, such as those targeting Azure AD, may require additional detection analyses.</p><p><strong>Detection Method 1 - Correlating service provider login events with corresponding authentication events in ADFS and Domain Controllers</strong></p><p>When performing legitimate authentication to an on-prem ADFS, the following events are logged:</p><p>In the ADFS server Windows Security Event Log:</p><ul role="list"><li>Event id 1202 – “The Federation Service validated a new credential”.</li><li>Event id 1200 – &quot;The Federation Service issued a valid token”.</li></ul><p>In the Domain Controller Windows Security Event Log:</p><ul role="list"><li> Event id 4769 – “A Kerberos service ticket was requested”, the source IP being the ADFS.</li></ul><p>  In the service provider logs:</p><ul role="list"><li>Appropriate log for each service, indicating a successful login (e.g. ‘ConsoleLogin’ or ‘AssumeRoleWithSAML’ in AWS or &#x27;Sign-ins&#x27; in Azure AD).</li></ul><p>However, when authenticating with a Golden SAML forged response the only event logged is the login to the service provider. The ADFS and Domain Controller are not involved in the authentication process in this scenario, and therefore do not log any events. While an attacker may also create a TGS request leaving behind a Kerberos requests (Event id 4769) on the Domain Controller, they cannot successfully authenticate to ADFS and create the standard authentication events.</p><p>Therefore, in order to detect Golden SAML authentications we can simply search for any logins to service providers using SAML SSO, which do not have corresponding 4769, 1200 and 1202 events in the Domain.</p><p>This detection mechanism is powerful, as it strikes at the core difference between a legitimate SAML authentication and a Golden SAML attack.</p><p>In order to facilitate this analysis, ensure the above mentioned events are enabled in audit policy:</p><ul role="list"><li>Audit ObjectAccess: success and failure on ADFS for event ids 1200 and 1202.</li><li>AccountLogon - Kerberos Service Ticket Operations: success and failure on the Domain Controllers for event id 4769.</li><li>Applicable login audit logs from service provider.</li></ul><p>‍<strong>Detection Method 2 – Identifying certificate export events in ADFS</strong></p><p>As previously mentioned, a Golden SAML attack requires the private key and certificate of the ADFS. Access to these can be obtained by exporting the certificate from the ADFS server, generating event id 1007 (enabled by default) in the ‘Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-System’ Windows Event Log.</p><p>Additionally, command-line evidence for exporting the ADFS certificate is likely incriminating. In many cases these can be found in:</p><ul role="list"><li>PowerShell script block logs: &#x27;Export-PfxCertificate&#x27; or &#x27;certutil -exportPFX&#x27; in event ids 4103 and 4104.</li><li>Command line auditing tools (e.g. event id 4688): using certutil.exe -exportPFX.</li><li>Execution evidence of known tools such as Mimikatz and ADFSDump. Certificate extraction with ADFSdump can be detected using Sysmon Event id 18, when the pipe name is “\microsoft##wid\tsql\query”, excluding processes regularly making this pipe connection on the machine.</li></ul><p><strong>Detection Method 3 – Customizing SAML response to identify irregular access</strong></p><p>In order to facilitate an additional layer of monitoring, organizations can modify their SAML responses to include custom elements for each service provider. Once enabled, these custom elements can be monitored in service provider access logs to detect any anomalous requests. While these parameters can be faked by an attacker, they’re likely to be different and facilitate effective detection of Golden SAML attacks.</p><p><strong>Detection Method 4 – Detecting malicious ADFS trust modification</strong></p><p>An attacker gaining administrative access to ADFS may, instead of extracting the certificate and private key for a standard Golden SAML attack, add a new trusted ADFS. This approach will enable them to sign valid SAML responses and gain persistent access to resources, while evading detection by methods 1-3 . This attack can be detected by monitoring the creation of new ADFS trust, using these events in the ADFS server Windows Security Event Log:</p><ul role="list"><li>Event id 307 – “The Federation Service configuration was changed”. This event can be correlated to relevant event 510 with the same Instance ID for change details.</li><li>Event id 510 with the same Instance ID – could be more than one event per single 307 event. These events should be reviewed, specifically searching for “Configuration: Type: IssuanceAuthority“ where “Property Value” references an unfamiliar Domain.</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>[1] CISA Alert (AA20-352A)Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies, Critical Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations.</p></div></div></div><div class="section-2 mata-bg hidden"><div class="container-5 w-container"><h1 class="h1 hpph ap bp">Detection and Hunting of Golden SAML Attack<br/></h1><p class="p ap">Sygnia deploys top talent and implements the operational art of elite military units, digital combat experience, and a deep understanding of attackers to secure organizations.</p><p class="p ap-author">December 2020</p><div class="inner-page-rich-text w-richtext"><h4>Background</h4><p>The SolarWinds software supply chain attack is known to have affected U.S. government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private sector organizations by an advanced persistent threat actor since at least March 2020.

While these architectures may vary significantly, we decided to focus our attention in this section on two main potential architectures: Cloud identity providers and multiple/hybrid identity provider architectures.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Multiple Identity Provider Architectures<br/>‍</strong>As different architectures may utilize multiple ADFS instances from different Domains or organizations, it is vital to ensure log collection and analysis is performed on all relevant ADFS. When utilizing a multiple-ADFS or hybrid ADFS-Azure AD architecture, different tokens are created by each identity  provider. Attackers targeting this infrastructure can compromise one identity provider, leaving no trace of malicious activity on the other. This means legitimate authentication events may be viewed on the ADFS or Azure AD instance authenticating with the service provider, but not on all upstream instances which may have been attacked, as can be seen in <strong>Figure 3</strong>. To ensure effective detection, each ADFS trust relationship should be analyzed as an IDP-SP pair, following the same logic applied in the previous section (detection methods 1-3).</li><li>‍<strong>Cloud Only Identity Provider Architectures<br/>‍</strong>Federation architecture only utilizing Azure AD as an identity provider mitigates the standard Golden SAML attack vector, as the certificate and private key are stored in Azure instead of in ADFS on-prem. However, an attacker gaining administrative access to Azure AD may add federated ADFS instances under their control, thereby enabling themselves to sign valid SAML responses and gain persistent access to resources. While not a classic Golden SAML attack, this attack can be detected by monitoring the “Set federation settings on domain” activity type and ensuring no unknown ADFS instances are federated to Azure AD. It is also recommended to verify existing federation under Azure AD Connect, to detect previous compromise.</li></ul><figure style="max-width:1401pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/594bb4be5d975d31da8bea55/5fe34bfc770a092055b3d6c4_Golden%20Advisory%20-%20image%203%20with%20border.PNG" loading="lazy" alt=""/></div><figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Multi Identity Provider SAML Architecture</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>[1] CISA Alert (AA20-352A)Advanced Persistent Threat Compromise of Government Agencies, Critical Infrastructure, and Private Sector Organizations.</p></div></div></div><div class="main-footer"><div class="rd-container footer-wrapper"><div class="footer-content-wrapper hidden"><div class="footer-cols"><div class="footer-col"><a href="/" class="footer-link-block w-inline-block"><div class="footer-header">HOME</div></a></div><div class="footer-col"><div class="footer-link-block"><div class="footer-header">SERVICES</div></div><a href="/proactive-defense" class="footer-link-block w-inline-block"><div class="footer-header black">PROACTIVE DEFENSE</div></a><a href="/threat-response" class="footer-link-block w-inline-block"><div class="footer-header black">THREAT RESPONSE</div></a><a href="/" class="footer-link-block w-inline-block"><div class="footer-header black">OFFENSIVE SECURITY</div></a></div><div class="footer-col"><div class="footer-link-block"><div class="footer-header">LATEST RESOURCES</div></div><a href="/mata-framework" class="footer-link-block w-inline-block"><div class="footer-lr-link">Lazarus Group’s MATA Framework Leveraged to Deploy TFlower Ransomware</div></a><a href="/golden-saml-advisory" aria-current="page" class="footer-link-block w-inline-block w--current"><div class="footer-lr-link">Detection and Hunting of Golden SAML Attack</div></a><a href="/cloudscout" class="footer-link-block w-inline-block"><div class="footer-lr-link">Cloud Scout: A New Open Source Tool for Cloud Security</div></a></div><div class="footer-col"><a href="/contact-us" class="footer-link-block w-inline-block"><div class="footer-header">CONTACT US</div></a></div></div><div class="footer-logo"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/594bb4be5d975d31da8bea55/5fce69d9338e1a4922628168_Logo.svg" loading="lazy" alt=""/></div></div><div class="footer-devider"></div><div class="copy-rights"><div class="div-block-31"><div class="text-block-7">Copyright © <span id="date">2021</span> Sygnia, Inc.
